# Web_Scraper
This project implements a web scraping tool using Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Streamlit to fetch and display product data from Flipkart. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can initiate the scraping process, view the scraped data in a structured format, and download it as a CSV file for further analysis.
